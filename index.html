        <p>Aesop and Worldwide present a 60-minute mixtape of carefully-curated music to form a place where aroma and audio meet, meld and become intertwined. Each Radiomatique Mixtape will be a reflection of its creator and the series will be broadcast on Sunday afternoons throughout 2022 to provide moments that nourish and refresh.</p>

    <h2>Series One</h2>

    <h3 class="nedda">Nedda Sou</h3>

    <p>In the first of the series, we invite Nedda Sou to select music that evokes strong memories and feelings to re-energise you for the week ahead. Nedda Sou is a multi-disciplinary artist who grew up in the Hague in a mixed-race Moroccan household. Nedda’s creative output encompasses music, dance and theatre, while through her work as a teacher and mentor she champions the power of community and honest role models.</p>
            
    <h3 class="closetyi">Closet Yi</h3>

    <p>Closet Yi is a DJ and producer based in Seoul, South Korea. She has played at some of the most respected underground clubs in Seoul, including Cakeshop, Faust, Pistil, Contra and more. She has recently released on Korea’s only electronic music label Honey Badger Records with her ‘Ruminate’ EP, as well as London based labels all my thoughts and No Bad Days. Her career at the Hyundai Card music Library as a resident DJ and librarian for two years has influenced her to go beyond dance music genres, and to expand her passion further through traditional and modern Korean sounds, other worldly music and rare archived samples. This became the source of inspiration for the unique atmosphere in her tracks. She’s the kind of DJ you might find spinning in a dusty record bar in Seoul, or playing to a thousand people on a Funktion-one sound system.</p>

    <h3 class="nedda">Shii</h3>

    <p>Shii is a Chengdu indie electronic artist currently residing in Wuhan, China. Her production draws elements from IDM, art-pop and dream-pop, merging them into catchy, fluent melodies. Shii has been invited to perform in Simple Life Festival, StreetVoice’s The Big Landing, Fete de la Musique and more. She signed with Beijing label Merrie Records in early 2019, and her debut Floating Signifiers” and EP record “Duration” were released in July and November 2019.</p>
